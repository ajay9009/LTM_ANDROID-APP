      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Basic input/output</span></h2>
      <p>The C++ standard libraries provide an extensive set of input/output capabilities which we will see in
         subsequent chapters. This chapter will discuss very basic and most common I/O operations required for C++
         programming.</p>
      <p>C++ I/O occurs in streams, which are sequences of bytes. If bytes flow from a device like a keyboard, a disk
         drive, or a network connection etc. to main memory, this is called <strong>input operation</strong> and if
         bytes flow from main memory to a device like a display screen, a printer, a disk drive, or a network
         connection, etc., this is called <strong>output operation</strong>.</p>
      <h3>I/O Library Header Files</h3>
      <p>There are following header files important to C++ programs &minus;</p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <th>Sr.No</th>
               <th>Header File &amp; Function and Description</th>

                  <p><strong>&lt;iostream&gt;</strong></p>
                  <p>This file defines the <strong>cin, cout, cerr</strong> and <strong>clog</strong> objects, which
                     correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error
                     stream and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.</p>

                  <p>This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O with so-called parameterized stream
                     manipulators, such as <strong>setw</strong> and <strong>setprecision</strong>.</p>

            <tr>
               <td class="ts">3.</td>
               <td>
                  <p><strong>&lt;fstream&gt;</strong></p>
                  <p>This file declares services for user-controlled file processing. We will discuss about it in detail
                     in File and Stream related chapter.</p>

      <h3>The Standard Output Stream (cout)</h3>
      <p>The predefined object <strong>cout</strong> is an instance of <strong>ostream</strong> class. The cout object
         is said to be "connected to" the standard output device, which usually is the display screen. The
         <strong>cout</strong> is used in conjunction with the stream insertion operator, which is written as &lt;&lt;
         which are two less than signs as shown in the following example.</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="10" readonly>
#include <iostream>
 
   using namespace std;
             
   int main() {
      char str[] = "Hello C++";
             
      cout << "Value of str is : " << str << endl;
   }
</textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>Value of str is : Hello C++</strong></pre>
      <p>The C++ compiler also determines the data type of variable to be output and selects the appropriate stream
         insertion operator to display the value. The &lt;&lt; operator is overloaded to output data items of built-in
         types integer, float, double, strings and pointer values.</p>
      <p>The insertion operator &lt;&lt; may be used more than once in a single statement as shown above and
         <strong>endl</strong> is used to add a new-line at the end of the line.</p>
      <h3>The Standard Input Stream (cin)</h3>
      <p>The predefined object <strong>cin</strong> is an instance of <strong>istream</strong> class. The cin object is
         said to be attached to the standard input device, which usually is the keyboard. The <strong>cin</strong> is
         used in conjunction with the stream extraction operator, which is written as &gt;&gt; which are two greater
         than signs as shown in the following example.</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="12" readonly>
#include <iostream>
 
   using namespace std;
                
   int main() {
      char name[50];
                
      cout << "Please enter your name: ";
      cin >> name;
      cout << "Your name is: " << name << endl;
                
   }
         </textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it will prompt you to enter a name. You enter a value and then
         hit enter to see the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>PLease enter your name: cplusplus
Your name is: cplusplus</strong>
</pre>
      <p>The C++ compiler also determines the data type of the entered value and selects the appropriate stream
         extraction operator to extract the value and store it in the given variables.</p>
      <p>The stream extraction operator &gt;&gt; may be used more than once in a single statement. To request more than
         one datum you can use the following &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>cin &gt;&gt; name &gt;&gt; age;</strong></pre>
      <p>This will be equivalent to the following two statements &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>cin &gt;&gt; name;
cin &gt;&gt; age;</strong>
</pre>
      <h3>The Standard Error Stream (cerr)</h3>
      <p>The predefined object <strong>cerr</strong> is an instance of <strong>ostream</strong> class. The cerr object
         is said to be attached to the standard error device, which is also a display screen but the object
         <strong>cerr</strong> is un-buffered and each stream insertion to cerr causes its output to appear immediately.
      </p>
      <p>The <strong>cerr</strong> is also used in conjunction with the stream insertion operator as shown in the
         following example.</p>
      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="12" readonly>
#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;
                
   int main() {

      char str[] = "Unable to read....";
                
      cerr << "Error message : " << str << endl;
   }
         </textarea>


      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>Error message : Unable to read....</strong></pre>
      <h3>The Standard Log Stream (clog)</h3>
      <p>The predefined object <strong>clog</strong> is an instance of <strong>ostream</strong> class. The clog object
         is said to be attached to the standard error device, which is also a display screen but the object
         <strong>clog</strong> is buffered. This means that each insertion to clog could cause its output to be held in
         a buffer until the buffer is filled or until the buffer is flushed.</p>
      <p>The <strong>clog</strong> is also used in conjunction with the stream insertion operator as shown in the
         following example.</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="10" readonly>
#include <iostream>
 
   using namespace std;
                
   int main() {
      char str[] = "Unable to read....";
                
      clog << "Error message : " << str << endl;
   }
         </textarea>


      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>Error message : Unable to read....</strong></pre>
      <p>You would not be able to see any difference in cout, cerr and clog with these small examples, but while writing
         and executing big programs the difference becomes obvious. So it is good practice to display error messages
         using cerr stream and while displaying other log messages then clog should be used.</p>
