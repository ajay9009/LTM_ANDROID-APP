      <h3>C++ Class Definitions</h3>
      <p>When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually define any data, but it
         does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations
         can be performed on such an object.</p>
      <p>A class definition starts with the keyword <strong>class</strong> followed by the class name; and the class
         body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed either by a semicolon or a list
         of declarations. For example, we defined the Box data type using the keyword <strong>class</strong> as follows
         &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="7" readonly>
class Box {
   public:
      double length;   // Length of a box
      double breadth;  // Breadth of a box
      double height;   // Height of a box
};
   
         </textarea>

      <p>The keyword <strong>public</strong> determines the access attributes of the members of the class that follows
         it. A public member can be accessed from outside the class anywhere within the scope of the class object. You
         can also specify the members of a class as <strong>private</strong> or <strong>protected</strong> which we will
         discuss in a sub-section.</p>
      <h3>Define C++ Objects</h3>
      <p>A class provides the blueprints for objects, so basically an object is created from a class. We declare objects
         of a class with exactly the same sort of declaration that we declare variables of basic types. Following
         statements declare two objects of class Box &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="3" readonly>
Box Box1;          // Declare Box1 of type Box
Box Box2;          // Declare Box2 of type Box
         </textarea>

      <p>Both of the objects Box1 and Box2 will have their own copy of data members.</p>
      <h3>Accessing the Data Members</h3>
      <p>The public data members of objects of a class can be accessed using the direct member access operator (.).</p>
      <p>It is important to note that private and protected members can not be accessed directly using direct member
         access operator (.). We will learn how private and protected members can be accessed.</p>
      <h3>Classes and Objects in Detail</h3>
      <p>So far, you have got very basic idea about C++ Classes and Objects. There are further interesting concepts
         related to C++ Classes and Objects which we will discuss in various sub-sections listed below &minus;</p>

                  <p>A member function of a class is a function that has its definition or its prototype within the
                     class definition like any other variable.</p>

                  <p>A class member can be defined as public, private or protected. By default, members would be assumed
                     as private.</p>

                  <p><strong>Constructor &amp; Destructor</strong></p>
                  <p>A class constructor is a special function in a class that is called when a new object of the class
                     is created. A destructor is also a special function which is called when a created object is
                     deleted.</p>

                  <p><strong>copy construtor</strong></p>
                  <p>The copy constructor is a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of
                     the same class, which has been created previously.</p>

                     class.</p>

                  <p>With an inline function, the compiler tries to expand the code in the body of the function in place
                     of a call to the function.</p>

                  <p>A pointer to a class is done exactly the same way a pointer to a structure is. In fact a class is
                     really just a structure with functions in it.</p>
