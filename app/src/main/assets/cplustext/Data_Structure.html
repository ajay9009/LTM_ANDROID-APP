      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Data Structures</span></h2>
      <p>C/C++ arrays allow you to define variables that combine several data items of the same kind,
         but <strong>structure</strong> is another user defined data type which allows you to combine data
         items of different kinds.</p>
      <p>Structures are used to represent a record, suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might
         want to track the following attributes about each book &minus;</p>
      <ul class="list">
         <li>Title</li>
         <li>Author</li>
         <li>Subject</li>
         <li>Book ID</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Defining a Structure</h3>
      <p>To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with
         more than one member, for your program. The format of the struct statement is this &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="50" rows="8" readonly>
struct [structure tag] {
   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more structure variables];
         </textarea>

      <p>The <strong>structure tag</strong> is optional and each member definition is a normal variable
         definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the structure's
         definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more structure variables but it is optional.
         Here is the way you would declare the Book structure &minus;</p>
      
         <textarea id="ta" cols="50" rows="8" readonly>
struct Books {
   char  title[50];
   char  author[50];
   char  subject[100];
   int   book_id;
} book;  
         </textarea>

      <h3>Accessing Structure Members</h3>
      <p>To access any member of a structure, we use the <strong>member access operator (.)</strong>. The member
         access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish
         to access. You would use <strong>struct</strong> keyword to define variables of structure type.</p>
      <h3>Structures as Function Arguments</h3>
      <p>You can pass a structure as a function argument in very similar way as you pass any other variable or pointer.
         You would access structure variables in the similar way as you have accessed in the above.</p>
      <h3>Pointers to Structures</h3>
      <p>You can define pointers to structures in very similar way as you define pointer to any other variable as
         follows &minus;</p>
      
      <pre><b>struct Books *struct_pointer;</b></pre>

      <p>Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the
         address of a structure variable, place the &amp; operator before the structure's name as follows &minus;</p>
      
      <pre><b>struct_pointer = &amp;Book1;</b></span></pre>

      <p>To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the -&gt; operator as
         follows &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>struct_pointer-&gt;title;</b></pre>
      <h3>The typedef Keyword</h3>
      <p>There is an easier way to define structs or you could "alias" types you create. For example &minus;</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="50" rows="8" readonly>
typedef struct {
   char  title[50];
   char  author[50];
   char  subject[100];
   int   book_id;
} Books;
      </textarea>

      <p>Now, you can use <em>Books</em> directly to define variables of <em>Books</em> type without
         using struct keyword. Following is the example &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>Books Book1, Book2;</b></pre>

      <p>You can use <strong>typedef</strong> keyword for non-structs as well as follows &minus;</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="50" rows="4" readonly>
typedef long int *pint32;
 
pint32 x, y, z;
      </textarea>
