      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Date and Time</span></h2>
      <p>The C++ standard library does not provide a proper date type. C++ inherits the structs and functions for date
         and time manipulation from C. To access date and time related functions and structures, you would need to
         include &lt;ctime&gt; header file in your C++ program.</p>
      <p>There are four time-related types: <strong>clock_t, time_t, size_t</strong>, and <strong>tm</strong>. The types
         - clock_t, size_t and time_t are capable of representing the system time and date as some sort of integer.</p>
      <p>Following are the important functions, which we use while working with date and time in C or C++. All these
         functions are part of standard C and C++ library and you can check their detail using reference to C++ standard
         library given below.</p>

                     1970. If the system has no time, .1 is returned.</p>

      <h3>Current Date and Time</h3>
      <p>Suppose you want to retrieve the current system date and time, either as a local time or as a Coordinated
         Universal Time (UTC). Following is the example to achieve the same &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="70" rows="10" readonly>
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>
            
using namespace std;
            
int main() {
   // current date/time based on current system
   time_t now = time(0);
               
   // convert now to string form
   char* dt = ctime(&now);
            
   cout << "The local date and time is: " << dt << endl;
            
   // convert now to tm struct for UTC
   tm *gmtm = gmtime(&now);
   dt = asctime(gmtm);
   cout << "The UTC date and time is:"<< dt << endl;
}   
</textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>The local date and time is: Sat Jan  8 20:07:41 2011

The UTC date and time is:Sun Jan  9 03:07:41 2011
</b></pre>
      <h3>Format Time using struct tm</h3>
      <p>The <strong>tm</strong> structure is very important while working with date and time in either C or C++. This
         structure holds the date and time in the form of a C structure as mentioned above. Most of the time related
         functions makes use of tm structure. Following is an example which makes use of various date and time related
         functions and tm structure &minus;</p>
      <p>While using structure in this chapter, I'm making an assumption that you have basic understanding on C
         structure and how to access structure members using arrow -&gt; operator.</p>
      
         <textarea id="ta" cols="70" rows="10" readonly>

using namespace std;
               
int main() {
   // current date/time based on current system
   time_t now = time(0);
               
   cout << "Number of sec since January 1,1970:" << now << endl;
               
   tm *ltm = localtime(&now);
               
   // print various components of tm structure.
   cout << "Year:" << 1900 + ltm->tm_year << endl;
   cout << "Month: "<< 1 + ltm->tm_mon<< endl;
   cout << "Day: "<<  ltm->tm_mday << endl;
   cout << "Time: "<< 1 + ltm->tm_hour << ":";
   cout << 1 + ltm->tm_min << ":";
   cout << 1 + ltm->tm_sec << endl;
}
         </textarea>
         
      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
