        <p>So far, we have been using the <strong>iostream</strong> standard library, which
            provides <strong>cin</strong> and <strong>cout</strong> methods for reading from
            standard input and writing to standard output respectively.</p>
        <p>This tutorial will teach you how to read and write from a file. This requires another standard C++ library
            called <strong>fstream</strong>, which defines three new data types &minus;</p>

                        <p>This data type represents the output file stream and is used to create files and to write
                            information to files.</p>

                        <p>This data type represents the file stream generally, and has the capabilities of both
                            ofstream and ifstream which means it can create files, write information to files, and read
                            information from files.</p>

        <p>To perform file processing in C++, header files &lt;iostream&gt; and &lt;fstream&gt; must be included in your
            C++ source file.</p>
        <h3>Opening a File</h3>
        <p>A file must be opened before you can read from it or write to it.
            Either <strong>ofstream</strong> or <strong>fstream</strong> object may be used to open
            a file for writing. And ifstream object is used to open a file for reading purpose only.</p>
        <p>Following is the standard syntax for open() function, which is a member of fstream, ifstream, and ofstream
            objects.</p>
        <pre><b>void open(const char *filename, ios::openmode mode);</b>
</pre>
        <p>Here, the first argument specifies the name and location of the file to be opened and the second argument of
            the <strong>open()</strong> member function defines the mode in which the file should be opened.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Sr.No</th>
                    <th>Mode Flag &amp; Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">1</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>ios::app</strong></p>
                        <p>Append mode. All output to that file to be appended to the end.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">2</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>ios::ate</strong></p>
                        <p>Open a file for output and move the read/write control to the end of the file.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">3</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>ios::in</strong></p>
                        <p>Open a file for reading.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">4</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>ios::out</strong></p>
                        <p>Open a file for writing.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">5</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>ios::trunc</strong></p>
                        <p>If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated before opening the file.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>You can combine two or more of these values by <strong>OR</strong>ing them together. For example if you
            want to open a file in write mode and want to truncate it in case that already exists, following will be the
            syntax &minus;</p>
        <pre><b>ofstream outfile;
outfile.open("file.dat", ios::out | ios::trunc );</b>
</pre>
        <p>Similar way, you can open a file for reading and writing purpose as follows &minus;</p>
        <pre><b>fstream  afile;
afile.open("file.dat", ios::out | ios::in );</b>
</pre>
        <h3>Closing a File</h3>
        <p>When a C++ program terminates it automatically flushes all the streams, release all the allocated memory and
            close all the opened files. But it is always a good practice that a programmer should close all the opened
            files before program termination.</p>
        <p>Following is the standard syntax for close() function, which is a member of fstream, ifstream, and ofstream
            objects.</p>
        <pre><b>void close();</b>
</pre>
        <h3>Writing to a File</h3>
        <p>While doing C++ programming, you write information to a file from your program using the stream insertion
            operator (&lt;&lt;) just as you use that operator to output information to the screen. The only difference
            is that you use an <strong>ofstream</strong> or <strong>fstream</strong> object instead
            of the <strong>cout</strong> object.</p>
        <h3>Reading from a File</h3>
        <p>You read information from a file into your program using the stream extraction operator (&gt;&gt;) just as
            you use that operator to input information from the keyboard. The only difference is that you use
            an <strong>ifstream</strong> or <strong>fstream</strong> object instead of
            the <strong>cin</strong> object.</p>
        <h3>File Position Pointers</h3>
        <p>Both <strong>istream</strong> and <strong>ostream</strong> provide member functions for
            repositioning the file-position pointer. These member functions are <strong>seekg</strong> ("seek
            get") for istream and <strong>seekp</strong> ("seek put") for ostream.</p>
        <p>The argument to seekg and seekp normally is a long integer. A second argument can be specified to indicate
            the seek direction. The seek direction can be <strong>ios::beg</strong> (the default) for
            positioning relative to the beginning of a stream, <strong>ios::cur</strong> for positioning
            relative to the current position in a stream or <strong>ios::end</strong> for positioning relative
            to the end of a stream.</p>
