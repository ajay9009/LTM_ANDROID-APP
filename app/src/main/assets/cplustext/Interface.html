      <p> </p>
      <p>An interface describes the behavior or capabilities of a C++ class without committing to a particular
         implementation of that class.</p>
      <p>The C++ interfaces are implemented using <strong>abstract classes</strong> and these abstract classes
         should not be confused with data abstraction which is a concept of keeping implementation details separate from
         associated data.</p>
      <p>A class is made abstract by declaring at least one of its functions as <strong>pure
            virtual</strong> function. A pure virtual function is specified by placing "= 0" in its declaration as
         follows &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="10" readonly>
class Box {
   public:
      // pure virtual function
      virtual double getVolume() = 0;
      
   private:
      double length;      // Length of a box
      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box
      double height;      // Height of a box
};
         </textarea>

      <p>The purpose of an <strong>abstract class</strong> (often referred to as an ABC) is to provide an
         appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. Abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate
         objects and serves only as an <strong>interface</strong>. Attempting to instantiate an object of an
         abstract class causes a compilation error.</p>
      <p>Thus, if a subclass of an ABC needs to be instantiated, it has to implement each of the virtual functions,
         which means that it supports the interface declared by the ABC. Failure to override a pure virtual function in
         a derived class, then attempting to instantiate objects of that class, is a compilation error.</p>
      <p>Classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called <strong>concrete classes</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Designing Strategy</h3>
      <p>An object-oriented system might use an abstract base class to provide a common and standardized interface
         appropriate for all the external applications. Then, through inheritance from that abstract base class, derived
         classes are formed that operate similarly.</p>
      <p>The capabilities (i.e., the public functions) offered by the external applications are provided as pure virtual
         functions in the abstract base class. The implementations of these pure virtual functions are provided in the
         derived classes that correspond to the specific types of the application.</p>
      <p>This architecture also allows new applications to be added to a system easily, even after the system has been
         defined.</p>
