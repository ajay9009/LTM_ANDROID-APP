        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Multithreading</span></h2>
        <p>A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is
            called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.</p>
        <p>C++ does not contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. Instead, it relies entirely upon
            the operating system to provide this feature.</p>
        <p>This tutorial assumes that you are working on Linux OS and we are going to write multi-threaded C++ program
            using POSIX. POSIX Threads, or Pthreads provides API which are available on many Unix-like POSIX systems
            such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris.</p>
        <h3>Creating Threads</h3>
        <p>The following routine is used to create a POSIX thread &minus;</p>
        <pre><b>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
pthread_create (thread, attr, start_routine, arg)</b>
</pre>
        <p>Here, <strong>pthread_create</strong> creates a new thread and makes it executable. This routine
            can be called any number of times from anywhere within your code. Here is the description of the parameters</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Sr.No</th>
                    <th>Parameter &amp; Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">1</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>thread</strong></p>
                        <p>An opaque, unique identifier for the new thread returned by the subroutine.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">2</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>attr</strong></p>
                        <p>An opaque attribute object that may be used to set thread attributes. You can specify a
                            thread attributes object, or NULL for the default values.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">3</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>start_routine</strong></p>
                        <p>The C++ routine that the thread will execute once it is created.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="ts">4</td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>arg</strong></p>
                        <p>A single argument that may be passed to start_routine. It must be passed by reference as a
                            pointer cast of type void. NULL may be used if no argument is to be passed.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The maximum number of threads that may be created by a process is implementation dependent. Once created,
            threads are peers, and may create other threads. There is no implied hierarchy or dependency between
            threads.</p>
        <h3>Terminating Threads</h3>
        <p>There is following routine which we use to terminate a POSIX thread &minus;</p>
        <pre><b>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
pthread_exit (status) </b>
</pre>
        <p>Here <strong>pthread_exit</strong> is used to explicitly exit a thread. Typically, the
            pthread_exit() routine is called after a thread has completed its work and is no longer required to exist.
        </p>
        <p>If main() finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with pthread_exit(), the other threads will
            continue to execute. Otherwise, they will be automatically terminated when main() finishes.</p>
