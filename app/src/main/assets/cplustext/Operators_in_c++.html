        <h3>Operators Precedence in C++</h3>
        <p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is
            evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator
            has higher precedence than the addition operator &minus;</p>
        <p>For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so
            it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
        <p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at
            the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
