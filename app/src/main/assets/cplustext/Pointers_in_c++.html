      <p>C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++
         tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.</p>
      <p>As you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be
         accessed using ampersand (&amp;) operator which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following which will
         print the address of the variables defined &minus;</p>

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  var1;
   char var2[10];
               
   cout << "Address of var1 variable: ";
   cout << &var1 << endl;
               
   cout << "Address of var2 variable: ";
   cout << &var2 << endl;
               
   return 0;
}
         </textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>Address of var1 variable: 0xbfebd5c0
Address of var2 variable: 0xbfebd5b6
</b></pre>
      <h3>What are Pointers?</h3>
      <p>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any
         variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer
         variable declaration is &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>type *var-name;</b>
</pre>
      <p>Here, <strong>type</strong> is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type
         and <strong>var-name</strong> is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a
         pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being
         used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>int    *ip;    // pointer to an integer
double *dp;    // pointer to a double
float  *fp;    // pointer to a float
char   *ch     // pointer to character</b>
</pre>
      <p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the
         same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of
         different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
      <h3>Using Pointers in C++</h3>
      <p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very
         frequently. <strong>(a)</strong> We define a pointer variable. <strong>(b)</strong> Assign
         the address of a variable to a pointer. <strong>(c)</strong> Finally access the value at the address
         available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the
         variable located at the address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
               
int main () {
   int  var = 20;   // actual variable declaration.
   int  *ip;        // pointer variable 
               
   ip = &var;       // store address of var in pointer variable
               
   cout << "Value of var variable: ";
   cout << var << endl;
               
   // print the address stored in ip pointer variable
   cout << "Address stored in ip variable: ";
   cout << ip << endl;
               
   // access the value at the address available in pointer
   cout << "Value of *ip variable: ";
   cout << *ip << endl;
               
   return 0;
}
         </textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces result something as follows &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>Value of var variable: 20
Address stored in ip variable: 0xbfc601ac
Value of *ip variable: 20
</b></pre>
      <h3>Pointers in C++</h3>
      <p>Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming. There are following few
         important pointer concepts which should be clear to a C++ programmer &minus;</p>
