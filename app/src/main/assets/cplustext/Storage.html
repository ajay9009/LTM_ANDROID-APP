      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Storage in c++</span></h2>
      <p>A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C++
         Program. These specifiers precede the type that they modify. There are following storage classes, which can be
         used in a C++ Program</p>
      <ul>
         <li>auto</li>
         <li>register</li>
         <li>static</li>
         <li>extern</li>
         <li>mutable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The auto Storage Class</h3>
      <p>The <strong>auto</strong> storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.</p>
      <pre><b>{
   int mount;
   auto int month;
}</b></pre>
      <p>The example above defines two variables with the same storage class, auto can only be used within functions,
         i.e., local variables.</p>
      <h3>The register Storage Class</h3>
      <p>The <strong>register</strong> storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a
         register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually
         one word) and can't have the unary '&amp;' operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).</p>
      <pre><b>{
   register int  miles;
}</b></pre>
      <p>The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be
         noted that defining 'register' does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it
         MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.</p>
      <h3>The static Storage Class</h3>
      <p>The <strong>static</strong> storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during
         the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of
         scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.
      </p>
      <p>The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable's scope
         to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.</p>
      <p>In C++, when static is used on a class data member, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all
         objects of its class.</p>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="10" readonly>
#include <iostream>
 
// Function declaration
void func(void);
                
static int count = 10; /* Global variable */
                
main() {
   while(count--) {
      func();
   }
   
   return 0;
}
               
// Function definition
void func( void ) {
   static int i = 5; // local static variable
   i++;
   std::cout << "i is " << i ;
   std::cout << " and count is " << count << std::endl;
}
         </textarea>

      <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre><b>i is 6 and count is 9
i is 7 and count is 8
i is 8 and count is 7
i is 9 and count is 6
i is 10 and count is 5
i is 11 and count is 4
i is 12 and count is 3
i is 13 and count is 2
i is 14 and count is 1
i is 15 and count is 0
</b></pre>
      <h3>The extern Storage Class</h3>
      <p>The <strong>extern</strong> storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to
         ALL the program files. When you use 'extern' the variable cannot be initialized as all it does is point the
         variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.</p>
      <p>When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will be used in other files
         also, then <em>extern</em> will be used in another file to give reference of defined variable or function. Just
         for understanding <em>extern </em>is used to declare a global variable or function in another file.</p>
      <p>The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or
         functions as explained below.</p>
      <h3>First File: main.cpp</h3>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="8" readonly>
#include <iostream>
int count ;
extern void write_extern();
             
main() {
   count = 5;
   write_extern();
}
      </textarea>

      <h3>Second File: support.cpp</h3>

      <textarea id="ta" cols="60" rows="8" readonly>
#include <iostream>

extern int count;
            
void write_extern(void) {
   std::cout << "Count is " << count << std::endl;
}
      </textarea>

      <h3>The mutable Storage Class</h3>
      <p>The <strong>mutable</strong> specifier applies only to class objects, which are discussed later in this
         tutorial. It allows a member of an object to override the const member function. That is, a mutable member can
         be modified by a const member function.</p>
