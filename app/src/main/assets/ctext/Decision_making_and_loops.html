        <p></p>
        <p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or
            tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to
            be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>
        <p>Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming
            languages &minus;</p>
        <img src="Capture.png" alt="Decision making statements in C" width="300px" />
        <p>C programming language assumes any <strong>non-zero</strong> and <strong>non-null</strong> values
            as <strong>true</strong>, and if it is
            either <strong>zero</strong> or <strong>null</strong>, then it is assumed
            as <strong>false</strong> value.</p>
        <p>C programming language provides the following types of decision-making statements.</p>

        <h3>The ? : Operator</h3>
        <p>We have covered the <strong>conditional operator? :</strong> in the previous chapter which can be
            used to replace <strong>if...else</strong> statements. It has the following general form &minus;
        </p>
        <p>Exp1? Exp2: Exp3;</p>
        <p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>
        <p>The value of a? the expression is determined like this &minus;</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire?
                expression.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the
                expression.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">LOOP</span></h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Given below is the
            general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

        <p>C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

        <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>
        <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all
            automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
        <p>C supports the following control statements -</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">

        <h3>The Infinite Loop</h3>
        <p>A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The <strong>for</strong> loop
            is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are
            required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.</p>
        <textarea id="ta" cols="55" rows="10">
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    for(; ;) {
        printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
        </textarea>

        <p><strong>NOTE &minus; You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.</strong></p>
        <hr />
        <h2 align="center"><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>FUNCTION</strong></span></h2>

        <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function,
            which is <strong>main()</strong>, and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
        </p>
        <p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is
            up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.</p>
        <p>A function <strong>declaration</strong> tells the compiler about a function's name, return type,
            and parameters. A function <strong>definition</strong> provides the actual body of the function.
        </p>
        <p>The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For
            example, <strong>strcat()</strong> to concatenate two
            strings, <strong>memcpy()</strong> to copy one memory location to another location, and many more
            functions.</p>
        <p>A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.</p>
        <h3>Defining a Function</h3>
        <p>The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows &minus;</p>
        <textarea id="ta" cols="40" rows="6">
return_type function_name(parameter list)
{
    body of the function
}
        </textarea>
        <p>A function definition in C programming consists of a <em>function header</em> and
            a <em>function body</em>. Here are all the parts of a function &minus;</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <p><strong>Return Type</strong> &minus; A function may return a value.
                    The <strong>return_type</strong> is the data type of the value the function returns. Some
                    functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is
                    the keyword <strong>void</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Function Name</strong> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. The function
                    name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Parameters</strong> &minus; A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is
                    invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or
                    argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function.
                    Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Function Body</strong> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements
                    that define what the function does.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Function Arguments</h3>
        <p>If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These
            variables are called the <strong>formal parameters</strong> of the function.</p>
        <p>Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the
            function and destroyed upon exit.</p>
        <p>While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function &minus;</p>

                <td><strong>Call by value</strong>
                    <p>This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
                        In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the
                        argument.</p>

                <td><strong>Call by reference</strong>
                    <p>This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function,
                        the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes
                        made to the parameter affect the argument.</p>

        <h2 align="center"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Scope value</span></h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>A scope in any programming is a region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and
            beyond that variable, it cannot be accessed. There are three places where variables can be declared in C
            programming language &minus;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Inside a function or a block which is called <strong>local</strong> variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Outside of all functions which are called <strong>global</strong> variables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the definition of function parameters which are
                    called <strong>formal</strong> parameters.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let us understand what are <strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong> variables,
            and <strong>formal</strong> parameters.</p>
        <h3>Local Variables</h3>
        <p>Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables. They can be used only by
            statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions
            outside their own. The following example shows how local variables are used. Here all the variables a, b,
            and c are local to main() function.</p>
        <textarea id="ta" cols="55" rows="10" readonly>
#include<stdio.h>
int g;
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    a=10;
    b=20;
    g=a+b;
    printf("value of a=%d, b=%d and g=%d\n", a,b,g);
    return 0;
}
            </textarea>
        <h3>Initializing Local and Global Variables</h3>
        <p>When a local variable is defined, it is not initialized by the system, you must initialize it yourself.
            Global variables are initialized automatically by the system when you define them as follows &minus;</p>

        </table>
        <p>It is a good programming practice to initialize variables properly, otherwise your program may produce
            unexpected results, because uninitialized variables will take some garbage value already available at their
            memory location.</p>
