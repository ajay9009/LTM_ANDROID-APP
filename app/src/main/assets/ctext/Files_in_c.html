        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">FILE I/O</span></h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The last chapter explained the standard input and output devices handled by C programming language. This
            chapter cover how C programmers can create, open, close text or binary files for their data storage.</p>
        <p>A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file or a binary file. C programming
            language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on
            your storage devices. This chapter will take you through the important calls for file management.</p>
        <h2>Opening Files</h2>
        <p>You can use the <strong>fopen( )</strong> function to create a new file or to open an existing
            file. This call will initialize an object of the type <strong>FILE</strong>, which contains all the
            information necessary to control the stream. The prototype of this function call is as follows &minus;</p>
        <p><strong>FILE *fopen(const char * filename, const char * mode);</strong></p>
        <p>Here, <strong>filename</strong> is a string literal, which you will use to name your file, and
            access <strong>mode</strong> can have one of the following values &minus;</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Sr.No.</th>
                <th>Mode &amp; Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">1.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>r</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">2.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>w</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your
                        program will start writing content from the beginning of the file.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">3.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>a</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is
                        created. Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">4.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>r+</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">5.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>w+</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if
                        it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="ts">6.</td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>a+</strong></p>
                    <p>Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The
                        reading will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Closing a File</h2>
        <p>To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is &minus;</p>
        <p><strong>int fclose(FILE *fp);</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The <strong>fclose(-)</strong> function returns zero on success,
            or <strong>EOF</strong> if there is an error in closing the file. This function actually flushes
            any data still pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any memory used for the
            file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file <strong>stdio.h</strong>.</p>
        <p>There are various functions provided by C standard library to read and write a file, character by character,
            or in the form of a fixed length string.</p>

        <h2>Writing a File</h2>
        <p>Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream &minus;</p>
        <p><strong>int fputc(int c, FILE *fp);</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Reading a File</h2>
        <p>Given below is the simplest function to read a single character from a file &minus;</p>
        <p><strong>int fgetc( FILE * fp );</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>fgetc()</strong> function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The
            return value is the character read, or in case of any error, it returns <strong>EOF</strong>. The
            following function allows to read a string from a stream &minus;</p>
        <p><strong>char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );
        </strong></p>
        <p>The functions <strong>fgets()</strong> reads up to n-1 characters from the input stream referenced
            by fp. It copies the read string into the buffer <strong>buf</strong>, appending
            a <strong>null</strong> character to terminate the string.</p>
        <p>If this function encounters a newline character '\n' or the end of the file EOF before they have read the
            maximum number of characters, then it returns only the characters read up to that point including the new
            line character. You can also use <strong>int fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format,
                ...)</strong> function to read strings from a file, but it stops reading after encountering the
            first space character.</p>
