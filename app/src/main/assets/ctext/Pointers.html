<h3>What are Pointers?</h3>
<p>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is &minus;</p>
<p><strong>type *var-name;</strong></p>

<h3>How to Use Pointers?</h3>
<p>There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. <strong>(a)</strong> We define a pointer variable, <strong>(b)</strong> assign the address of a variable to a pointer and <strong>(c)</strong> finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator <strong>*</strong> that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. The following example makes use of these operations &minus;</p>

<textarea id="ta" cols="70" rows="10">
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
    int var = 20; /* actual variable declaration */
    int *ip; /* pointer variable declaration */
        
    ip = &var; /* store address of var in pointer variable*/
    printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var );
        
    /* address stored in pointer variable */
    printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );
        
    /* access the value using the pointer */
    printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );
        
    return 0;
}
</textarea>

<h3>NULL Pointers</h3>
<p>It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a <strong>null</strong> pointer.</p>
<p>The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries. Consider the following program &minus;</p>

<textarea id="ta" cols="50" rows="10">
#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
    int *ptr = NULL;
    printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", ptr );
    return 0;
}
</textarea>

<h3>Pointers in Detail</h3>
<p>Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer-</p>
