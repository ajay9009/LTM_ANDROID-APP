      <p>The <strong>C Preprocessor</strong> is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the
         compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the
         compiler
         to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.</p>
      <p>All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for
         readability,
         a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important
         preprocessor directives &minus;</p>

      <h3>Preprocessors Examples</h3>
      <p>Analyze the following examples to understand various directives.</p>
      <pre><strong>#define MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH 20</strong></pre>
      <p>This directive tells the CPP to replace instances of MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH with 20. Use <em>#define</em> for
         constants to increase readability.</p>
      <pre><strong>#include</strong> <strong>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</strong>
<strong>#include "myheader.h"</strong></pre>
      <p>These directives tell the CPP to get stdio.h from <strong>System Libraries</strong> and add the text to the
         current source file. The next line tells CPP to get <strong>myheader.h</strong> from the local directory
         and add the content to the current source file.</p>
      <pre><strong>#undef FILE_SIZE</strong>
<strong>#define FILE_SIZE </strong></pre>
      <p>It tells the CPP to undefine existing FILE_SIZE and define it as 42.</p>
      <pre><strong>#ifndef MESSAGE</strong>
<strong>#define MESSAGE You wish!</strong>
<strong>#endif</strong></pre>
      <p>It tells the CPP to define MESSAGE only if MESSAGE isn't already defined.</p>
      <pre><strong>#ifdef DEBUG</strong>
<strong>/* Your debugging statements here */</strong>
<strong>#endif</strong></pre>
      <p>It tells the CPP to process the statements enclosed if DEBUG is defined. This is useful if you pass
         the <em>-DDEBUG</em> flag to the gcc compiler at the time of compilation. This will define DEBUG, so you
         can turn debugging on and off on the fly during compilation.</p>

      <h3>Predefined Macros</h3>
      <p>ANSI C defines a number of macros. Although each one is available for use in programming, the predefined macros
         should not be directly modified.</p>

      <h3>Preprocessor Operators</h3>
      <p>The C preprocessor offers the following operators to help create macros &minus;</p>
      <h3>The Macro Continuation (\) Operator</h3>
      <p>A macro is normally confined to a single line. The macro continuation operator (\) is used to continue a macro
         that
         is too long for a single line. For example &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>#define message_for (a,b)  \
printf(#a " and " #b ": We love you!\n")</strong></pre>

      <h3>The Stringize (#) Operator</h3>
      <p>The stringize or number-sign operator ( '#' ), when used within a macro definition, converts a macro parameter
         into a
         string constant. This operator may be used only in a macro having a specified argument or parameter list.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Header
               Files</span></span>
      </h2>
      <p>A header file is a file with extension <strong>.h</strong> which contains C function declarations and macro
         definitions to be shared between several source files. There are two types of header files: the files that the
         programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.</p>
      <p>You request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing
         directive <strong>#include</strong>, like you have seen inclusion of <strong>stdio.h</strong> header
         file, which comes along with your compiler.</p>
      <p>Including a header file is equal to copying the content of the header file but we do not do it because it will
         be
         error-prone and it is not a good idea to copy the content of a header file in the source files, especially if
         we have
         multiple source files in a program.</p>
      <p>A simple practice in C or C++ programs is that we keep all the constants, macros, system wide global variables,
         and
         function prototypes in the header files and include that header file wherever it is required.</p>

      <h3>Include Syntax</h3>
      <p>Both the user and the system header files are included using the preprocessing
         directive <strong>#include</strong>. It has the following two forms &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>#include &lt;file&gt;</strong></pre>
      <p>This form is used for system header files. It searches for a file named 'file' in a standard list of system
         directories. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your source code.</p>
      <pre><strong>#include "file"</strong></pre>
      <p>This form is used for header files of your own program. It searches for a file named 'file' in the directory
         containing the current file. You can prepend directories to this list with the -I option while compiling your
         source
         code.</p>

      <h3>Include Operation</h3>
      <p>The <strong>#include</strong> directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan the specified file as
         input before continuing with the rest of the current source file. The output from the preprocessor contains the
         output already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included file, followed by the output that
         comes
         from the text after the <strong>#include</strong> directive. For example, if you have a header file
         header.h as follows &minus;</p>
      <pre><strong>char *test (void);</strong></pre>
      <p>and a main program called <em>program.c</em> that uses the header file, like this &minus;</p>
         <textarea id="ta" cols="30" rows="7" readonly>
int x;
#include "header.h"

int main (void) {
   puts (test ());
}
         </textarea>
      <p>The compiler will see the same token stream as it would if program.c read.</p>
      <textarea id="ta" cols="30" rows="7" readonly>
int x;
char *test (void);
         
int main (void) {
   puts (test ());
}
</textarea>

      <h3>Once-Only Headers</h3>
      <p>If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process its contents twice and it will result
         in an error. The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents of the file in a conditional,
         like this &minus;</p>
         <textarea id="ta" cols="30" rows="7" readonly>
#ifndef HEADER_FILE
#define HEADER_FILE
            
the entire header file file

#endif
         </textarea>

      <p>This construct is commonly known as a wrapper <strong>#ifndef</strong>. When the header is included again, the
         conditional will be false, because HEADER_FILE is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire contents
         of the
         file, and the compiler will not see it twice.</p>

      <h3>Computed Includes</h3>
      <p>Sometimes it is necessary to select one of the several different header files to be included into your program.
         For
         instance, they might specify configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating systems. You
         could
         do this with a series of conditionals as follows &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="30" rows="7" readonly>
#if SYSTEM_1
   # include "system_1.h"
#elif SYSTEM_2
   # include "system_2.h"
#elif SYSTEM_3
   ...
#endif
         </textarea>

      <p>But as it grows, it becomes tedious, instead the preprocessor offers the ability to use a macro for the header
         name.
         This is called a <strong>computed include</strong>. Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument
         of <strong>#include</strong>, you simply put a macro name there &minus;</p>

         <textarea id="ta" cols="30" rows="4" readonly>
#define SYSTEM_H "system_1.h"
...
#include SYSTEM_H
         </textarea>
      <p>SYSTEM_H will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for system_1.h as if
         the <strong>#include</strong> had been written that way originally. SYSTEM_H could be defined by your
         Makefile with a -D option.</p>
